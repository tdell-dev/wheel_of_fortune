# wheel_of_fortune
Many thanks to the team at buyavowel.boards.net for the compendiums which make up the puzzles for this program!

Project implementing the Wheel of Fortune game as close as possible to the show using ncurses.  Starting with Season 40, working backwards, starting with basic rounds and then adding prize rounds.  After, adding crossword and bonus rounds.
